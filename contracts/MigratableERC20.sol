 * @dev by the token holders. The new token contract starts with no initial supply and no balances. The only way to
 * @dev "mint" the new tokens is for users to "turn in" their old ones. This is done by first approving the amount they
 * @dev want to migrate via `ERC20.approve(newTokenAddress, amountToMigrate)` and then calling a function of the new
 * @dev token called `migrateTokens`. The old tokens are sent to a burn address, and the holder receives an equal amount
 * @dev in the new contract.
